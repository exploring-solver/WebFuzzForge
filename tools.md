2. **Core**
   - Functionality: Provides basic utilities and shared functions for other modules.
   - Use case: Centralizing common operations like HTTP requests, logging, and configuration management.
   - Testing: Unit test each utility function with various inputs.

3. **Custom Test Engine**
   - Functionality: Allows users to define and run custom security tests.
   - Use case: Testing application-specific logic or unique vulnerabilities not covered by standard tests.
   - Testing: Create sample custom tests and verify their execution and reporting.

4. **Directory Fuzzer**
   - Functionality: Enumerates directories and files on web servers.
   - Use case: Discovering hidden or sensitive directories that might contain vulnerabilities.
   - Testing: Set up a web server with known directory structure and verify discovery accuracy.

5. **Mitigation Engine**
   - Functionality: Suggests fixes and mitigations for discovered vulnerabilities.
   - Use case: Providing actionable remediation steps to developers and security teams.
   - Testing: Input sample vulnerabilities and verify the relevance and accuracy of suggested mitigations.

6. **Parameter Fuzzer**
   - Functionality: Tests URL parameters for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
   - Use case: Identifying input validation flaws in web applications.
   - Testing: Create a vulnerable web application and verify detection of known vulnerabilities.

7. **Reporting**
   - Functionality: Generates comprehensive reports of discovered vulnerabilities.
   - Use case: Providing clear, actionable information to stakeholders about security issues.
   - Testing: Input sample scan results and verify report accuracy and clarity.

8. **Subdomain Discovery**
   - Functionality: Identifies subdomains associated with a main domain.
   - Use case: Expanding the attack surface and identifying forgotten or misconfigured subdomains.
   - Testing: Use a domain with known subdomains and verify discovery accuracy.

9. **VHost Discovery**
   - Functionality: Identifies virtual hosts on a web server.
   - Use case: Discovering additional attack surfaces and potential misconfigurations in server setups.
   - Testing: Set up a server with multiple virtual hosts and verify discovery accuracy.

## Additional Packages for Early Vulnerability Detection

1. **Static Code Analysis Integration**
   - Functionality: Integrates with popular static code analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities in source code.
   - Use case: Detecting security issues during the development phase, before code is deployed.
   - Testing: Run against codebases with known vulnerabilities and verify detection accuracy.

2. **Dependency Scanner**
   - Functionality: Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
   - Use case: Identifying security risks in third-party libraries and components.
   - Testing: Create projects with dependencies that have known vulnerabilities and verify detection.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Functionality: Provides plugins or hooks for popular CI/CD tools to run WebFuzzForge scans automatically.
   - Use case: Automating security testing as part of the development and deployment process.
   - Testing: Set up sample CI/CD pipelines and verify successful integration and scanning.

4. **Git Hook Scanner**
   - Functionality: Implements pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks to run quick security checks.
   - Use case: Catching basic security issues before code is committed or pushed to a repository.
   - Testing: Set up a Git repository with the hooks and verify scanning on commit and push actions.

5. **Real-time Code Analysis**
   - Functionality: Integrates with IDEs to provide real-time security feedback as developers write code.
   - Use case: Educating developers about security best practices and catching issues during coding.
   - Testing: Integrate with popular IDEs and verify real-time feedback on intentionally vulnerable code.

6. **API Schema Validator**
   - Functionality: Validates API requests and responses against OpenAPI (Swagger) schemas.
   - Use case: Ensuring API implementations adhere to their specifications and catching potential security issues.
   - Testing: Create sample API schemas and test against both compliant and non-compliant API implementations.

7. **Container Security Scanner**
   - Functionality: Scans container images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
   - Use case: Identifying security issues in containerized applications before deployment.
   - Testing: Create container images with known vulnerabilities and verify detection accuracy.

8. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scanner**
   - Functionality: Analyzes IaC templates (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for security misconfigurations.
   - Use case: Catching potential security issues in cloud infrastructure before deployment.
   - Testing: Create IaC templates with known misconfigurations and verify detection accuracy.
